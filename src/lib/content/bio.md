**Hello, I am Cenk.**

I am the guy that might have one too many servers at home according to my wife and running complex setups that mostly serve me. But the plus side to that is I have big enough of a playground to experiment with new technologies as well as sharpening my skill-set to have a solution for novelty cases when I encounter them in real-life.

One of the joys of my life is to discuss this "nerdy" stuff with like-minded people and exchange ideas even though according to my experience they are rarer than unicorns.
